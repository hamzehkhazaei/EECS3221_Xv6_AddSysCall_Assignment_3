# Adding System Call in xv6

A comprehensive guide to adding custom system calls in the xv6 operating system.

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to implement a custom system call called `getyear` which returns 1975 from the kernel (the year Unix version 6 was released). Adding a new system call in xv6 requires modifying 5 key files in the operating system.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of C programming
- Familiarity with xv6 operating system structure
- Development environment set up with xv6 source code

## Files to Modify

To add a new system call in xv6, you need to modify the following files:

1. `syscall.h` - System call number definitions
2. `syscall.c` - System call dispatch table
3. `sysproc.c` - System call implementation
4. `usys.S` - User-space system call stubs
5. `user.h` - User-space function declarations

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Define System Call Number

Open `syscall.h` and add a new system call number. Since there are 21 existing system calls, we'll use number 22:

```c
#define SYS_getyear 22
```

### Step 2: Add Function Pointer to Dispatch Table

In `syscall.c`, add the function pointer to the system call dispatch table:

```c
[SYS_getyear] sys_getyear,
```

Also add the function prototype in the same file:

```c
extern int sys_getyear(void);
```

### Step 3: Implement the System Call Function

Open `sysproc.c` and add the implementation of your system call:

```c
// Return the year Unix version 6 was released
int
sys_getyear(void)
{
    return 1975;
}
```

### Step 4: Add User-Space Assembly Stub

In `usys.S`, add the assembly stub that will be called from user programs:

```assembly
SYSCALL(getyear)
```

### Step 5: Add User-Space Function Declaration

In `user.h`, add the function declaration that user programs will use:

```c
int getyear(void);
```

## Testing the System Call

Create a test user program to verify your system call works correctly:

```c
#include "types.h"
#include "stat.h"
#include "user.h"

int main(void)
{
    printf(1, "Note: Unix V6 was released in year %d\n", getyear());
    exit();
}
```

### Adding the Test Program

To include your test program in xv6:

1. Save the test program as `testyear.c` in the xv6 directory
2. Add `_testyear\` to the `UPROGS` section in the `Makefile`
3. Recompile and run xv6

## Building and Running

1. Compile xv6:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. Run xv6 in QEMU:
   ```bash
   make qemu
   ```

3. In the xv6 shell, run your test program:
   ```bash
   testyear
   ```

Expected output:
```
Note: Unix V6 was released in year 1975
```

## Understanding the Process

### System Call Flow

1. **User Program Call**: User program calls `getyear()`
2. **Assembly Stub**: `usys.S` stub puts system call number in register
3. **Kernel Trap**: CPU traps to kernel mode
4. **Dispatch**: `syscall()` function looks up system call number 22
5. **Execution**: `sys_getyear()` function executes and returns 1975
6. **Return**: Value is returned to user program

### Key Concepts

- **System Call Numbers**: Each system call has a unique number used for dispatch
- **Function Pointers**: The kernel uses a table of function pointers for efficient dispatch
- **User/Kernel Interface**: Assembly stubs bridge user-space and kernel-space
- **Return Values**: System calls can return integer values to user programs

## Advanced System Calls

For more complex system calls that take arguments:

```c
// Example: system call that takes an integer argument
int
sys_myfunction(void)
{
    int arg;
    
    // Get argument from user space
    if(argint(0, &arg) < 0)
        return -1;
    
    // Your implementation here
    return arg * 2;
}
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting to update all 5 files**: Missing any file will cause compilation errors
- **Incorrect system call numbers**: Using duplicate numbers will cause conflicts
- **Missing function prototypes**: Forgetting `extern` declarations in `syscall.c`
- **Assembly syntax**: Incorrect syntax in `usys.S` will cause build failures

## Debugging Tips

1. **Use `make qemu-nox-gdb`** for GDB debugging
2. **Check compilation errors** carefully - they usually point to missing modifications
3. **Verify system call numbers** are unique and consistent across files
4. **Test incrementally** - add print statements to verify execution flow

## Conclusion

Adding system calls to xv6 is a fundamental exercise in understanding operating system internals. The process involves creating bridges between user-space applications and kernel functionality, demonstrating the layered architecture of modern operating systems.

This implementation provides a foundation for more complex system calls that can interact with process management, file systems, and hardware resources.
